### What is this?

First off, yes, the name 'sudoexpert' is hilarious (thank you).

Second off, the name not-so-accurately surmises the point of this site, which is to share:

* Extremely exaggerated stories (some of which may be partly based on reality)
* Engineering experiences, development projects, and fun findings
* Links to cool articles, studies, and/or memes
* Quotable quotes

All of this in a (supposedly) humorous and mildly pleasant format.

### What does it take to become an expert?

Becoming an expert on something starts with taking an enormous leap of faith into the unknown to erect a foundation of knowledge and building on it until your tower of knowledge stands above the rest - often taking years, if not decades, of hard, immersive work and diligent studying.

_OR_

By following directions on StackOverflow and using a powerful four letter word to escalate your privileges to perform a task that you really have no experience with and calling yourself one.

### Are you an expert?

No, definitely not.

Maybe one day...  In something.
